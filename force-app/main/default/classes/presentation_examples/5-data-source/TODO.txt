Example test:

    OpportunityProductCanceller
    It uses an OpportunityProductDataSource

    Configure the DataSource with the Opportunity Ids you want the Products for, call getProducts

    ProductCanceller will:
        Loop over the products, check that they're not already fulfilled, and cancel the ones that aren't
        Have a method to allow you to get back the ones that need to be updated.

    This kind of thing is a common pattern:
        Splits:
            Data retrieval
            Data processing
            DML
        The thing on the outside controls what gets processed
        The processor does the processing
        The thing on the outside controls the DML
